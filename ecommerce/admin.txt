breeze description
Breeze is a laundry detergent brand from Unilever with more than 100 years of laundry expertise. 
Breeze believes taking action, alongside others, to have a positive impact on peopleâ€™s wellbeing, their communities, and the planet.
For change to happen, we would need to roll up our sleeves and get dirty. That's why Breeze is changing too. 
We are using more sustainable, yet powerful ingredients in our formulation and introducting less and better plastics in our packaging, empowering people to change.

Dirt for Good. Tougher on Stains. Kinder to our World.
